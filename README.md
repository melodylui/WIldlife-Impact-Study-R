## Project Overview

This project is an environmental data analysis focusing on wildlife sightings in the Pacific Northwest, leveraging R programming and GIS techniques. The main objective is to identify patterns and correlations between geographic locations, climatic conditions, and wildlife sightings to support habitat preservation efforts.

## Data Collection and Preparation

- The dataset includes geocoded reports of wildlife sightings with variables such as location, date, weather conditions, moon phase, and visibility.
- Data was filtered to focus on the Pacific Northwest region, specifically targeting sightings in Washington, Oregon, and Northern California.

## Data Analysis

- Created smaller data frames for specific states and seasons to streamline the analysis.
- Conducted seasonal and weather condition analyses to identify the most favorable conditions for wildlife sightings.
- Analyzed moon phases and their potential impact on wildlife activity.
- Visualized data using ggplot2 to create bar graphs and plots, highlighting seasonal trends, weather conditions, visibility, and moon phases.

## Geographic Analysis

- Utilized GIS techniques to map sightings in Humboldt and Siskiyou counties.
- Generated NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) plots using satellite imagery to assess vegetation density and its correlation with wildlife sightings.

## Results

- Identified that wildlife sightings are most frequent during the summer season.
- Highlighted specific counties with the highest concentration of sightings, emphasizing the need for targeted conservation efforts.
- Produced visualizations that provide clear insights into the environmental conditions influencing wildlife activity.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into the environmental and climatic factors affecting wildlife sightings, supporting conservation initiatives in the Pacific Northwest. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of using R and GIS tools in environmental data analysis and habitat preservation efforts.
